# Hello world!

I'm Sascha, a frontend web developer from Austria and I try to make **fast** and **accessible** websites.

Besides that, I'd like to play around with everything tech-related, get my hands on the nearest available DSLRs and travel different parts of the world. Want to know more? Visit my [About page](/about) for more information.
