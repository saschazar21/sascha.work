# Legal notice

The following contents should provide an overview about which information this website is processing, as well as how to contact me in case of questions.

## Data collection

This website does not store any cookies or tracking information by itself. Should you experience any unwanted behavior while visiting any of the pages prefixed with [https://sascha.work/](https://sascha.work/), please do not hesitate to contact me.

Should you choose a different theme via the [Theme Selector](#theme-selector), the website will store your choice in your browser's [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API). This way, the website is able to remember your choice during recurring visits or after page changes. Any value set to the `theme`-key will remain on your local machine and won't be transmitted anywhere else.

## Disclaimer

It so happens, that this website contains links to external websites (not prefixed with said _https://sascha.work/_). Although link targets are carefully checked against any inappropriate content beforehand, it does not mean their content does not change at a later date. Should you therefore witness any improper contents in any of those linked websites, please contact me immediately.
