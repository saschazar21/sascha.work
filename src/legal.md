## Data collection

This website does not store any cookies or tracking information by itself. However, it may happen that some blog posts contain references to 3rd party services (e.g. _twitter_, _YouTube_, etc...), which will then inject cookies on their behalf. Should you experience any unwanted behavior while visiting any of the pages prefixed with [https://sascha.work/](https://sascha.work/), please do not hesitate to contact me.

## Disclaimer

It so happens, that this website contains links to external websites (not prefixed with said _https://sascha.work/_). Although link targets are carefully checked against any inappropriate content beforehand, it does not mean their content does not change at a later date. Should you therefore witness any improper contents in any of those linked websites, please contact me immediately.
